Guess My Number Game

The Guess My Number game is an interactive number guessing application where users attempt to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 20. It provides real-time feedback and tracks the user's high score. The game is designed to offer a simple yet engaging user experience, focusing on dynamic interaction and responsiveness.

Unique Features:

 -- Dynamic User Interaction with Real-Time Feedback: As users input their guesses, they receive instant feedback (e.g., "Too High" or "Too Low"), enhancing the interactive nature of the game. The game updates the UI in real-time to reflect changes, creating an engaging experience with minimal delays.

 -- High Score Tracking Using Local Storage: The app keeps track of the user's high score using local storage, so the high score persists even after the game is refreshed and the 'Again' button is pressed. This feature showcases the ability to implement game state persistence without the need for backend services.

-- Interactive UI Elements with Smooth Animations: Buttons, text boxes, and feedback messages are enhanced with smooth hover and click animations, making the game feel more polished and interactive. The game's UI is minimalist yet intuitive, ensuring users can easily navigate the game without distractions.

 --Efficient Use of JavaScript for Game Logic: The core game logic is implemented using modern JavaScript (ES6+), ensuring efficient performance and responsiveness during gameplay. The game dynamically updates the DOM based on user input and state changes, providing a robust front-end experience.

 -- Reset Functionality: Players can reset the game at any time, with the game state reverting to its initial settings, allowing for replayability and seamless restarts.

 -- Simple and Clean UI: The design focuses on simplicity, with clearly labeled buttons and straightforward instructions that ensure users can jump into the game without a learning curve.

Technologies Used:

Front-End: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (ES6+)
